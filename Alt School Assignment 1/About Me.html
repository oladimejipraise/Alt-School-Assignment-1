                <p>Hello there &#x1F44B;<b>Oladimeji Olamide here</b>, I am a frontend engineering student at AltschoolAfrica with student ID <b>ALT/SOE/023/2388 </b> and it's super exciting to have you here.</p>
                <p>I look forward to chatting, networking and hopefully working with you, <em>so</em> come with me as I tell you a little bit about myself</p>
            </section>

            <h3>About Me</h3>
            Well, I am a frontend engineer, I enjoy creating user friendly applications that solves problens and is inclusive. I enjoy reading (sometimes), I love to cook, I enjoy singing 
            (not minding that I am Terrible at it), and i enjoy my own company; I won't describe myself as in introvert cause I don't mind having company, i'd just rather be by myself...So yeah

            <h3>Why I joined Altschool</h3>
            I first heard about AltSchool on Twitter and after not paying enough attention to it for a while, I looked it up and thought hmm, maybe this is the kind of community I've been looking for.
            I started my tech journey with Coursera where I was taking a course on UI/UX and don't get me wrong; I Enjoyed it. It just didn't have that <b>Community,</b> 
            so my learning was a bit slow because of the kind of learner I am. Finding <b>AltSchool, </b> I saw a community of learners, I found an opportunity to Network, I found a
            platform with like-minded people who just wanted to write code and it was super exciting. 
            <p>So, I registered, told a friend, and told another friend, and the rest they say is history!!! </p>
            

            <h3>What I hope to achieve with Altschool</h3>
            <em>I just want to code man...</em>Learn to write code, learn to solve problems (The first I think will be that Access Bank mobile App, which is really annoying to look at), Network, meet, and interact with great 
            minds, build, find new ways to fall in love with this career path, become so good at it, and then hopefully eat some tech money&#x1f609.</b>
